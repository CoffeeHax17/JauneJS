# JauneJS
A simple Jaune interpreter written in JavaScript for the Rhino JavaScript engine.

Jaune is an esoteric programming language. You can find more information here: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Jaune

This interpreter is still a work in progress and in experimental stage. Will work for most programs.
It can be used on other JavaScript engines or browsers by replacing the input/output functions in the source code.
